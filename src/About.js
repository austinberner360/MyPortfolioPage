              <p><h5>I've always been a creative person</h5>Playing musical instruments and assembling lego masterpieces is what I loved to do at a young age. That creative component in me continued through my life as I completed my AAS in Culinary Arts in my home town of Kalispell, Montana. Unfortunately, I couldn't find a career where I could flex my creative muscle and make a decent income.<br /><br />
                    Then a few years after I started a family, I found out about Web Developement and design through an old friend. It has fascinated me ever since I first Googled the details of the industry.<br /><br /> I have been learning and coding for just about a year now. Sometimes, I'm' so immersed in my studies that I'm unwilling to break away from the computer. I am now comfortable understanding how the developer environment, tools, source control packages, and other things work together. The languages that I'm comfortable working with are: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React.js., and I'm always learning more about both new and old languages.<br /><br />
                    I'm very excited to continue this journey into what I believe to be my dream job. I hope I can help develop for your business in the future!
